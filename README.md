# Fundamentals of Computing Final Project: Ramzi Soccer Shooter
Originally submitted to professor [Ramzi Bualuan](https://engineering.nd.edu/profiles/rbualuan) on December 12, 2017.

# Addendum
## TL;DR: Compile the program with `make` and run with `./project`
This was my final project for the first computer science class I ever took! When Andy and I were thinking of a project, we knew we had to involve our professor, Ramzi, in it somehow. We decided to put him on his favorite team, Barcelona, and have him score on his least favorite team, Real Madrid.  
Neither Andy nor I know anything about soccer, but hopefully this game will give you the same excitement you find while watching a real soccer game! You can find the instructions by pressing `i` once you run the program. Have fun!

NOTES:  
Due to the latency of connecting remotely to the student machines, some of the functions will take some time to load. Please be patient!  

To mitigate some lag and flickering, no colors were changed, as any color changes resulted in severe flickering which made the game unplayable.
